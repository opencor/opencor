OpenCOR is developed, and therefore built and tested, on Windows 7, Linux Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat; both 32-bit and 64-bit) and Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard). The following build instructions therefore assume that you are using one of these operating systems.

In order to build OpenCOR, you need the following tools:
 - Git (http://git-scm.com/ or the "git" package on Linux): this is the distributed version control system used to keep track of OpenCOR's source code, a copy of which can be cloned using either:
    - Read only:  git clone git://opencor.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/opencor/opencor
    - Read/write: git clone ssh://<username>@opencor.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/opencor/opencor
 - CMake 2.8+ (http://www.cmake.org/ or the "cmake" package on Linux): this is the cross-platform build system used to build OpenCOR; and
 - Qt Creator (http://qt.nokia.com/ or the "qtcreator" package on Linux): this is the cross-platform environment used to develop OpenCOR as a Qt 4.7+ application.
   Note: both CMake and Git are supported by Qt Creator, but Git might need configuring by selecting the "Tools"|"Options..." menu, then the "Version Control" section, and finally the "Git" tab. Alternatively, you can always use Git from the command line or, on Windows, using TortoiseGit (http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/).

Once the above tools are installed and you have cloned a copy of OpenCOR, follow the instructions below to build and run OpenCOR from Qt Creator:
 - Start Qt Creator;
 - Open "[OpenCOR]/CMakeLists.txt" (by selecting the "File"|"Open File or Project..." menu or by pressing Ctrl+O);
 - Specify "[OpenCOR]/build" as the build directory;
 - Select "MinGW" as the generator (only on Windows);
 - Click on the "Run CMake" button;
 - Click on the "Finish" button;
 - Select "OpenCOR" as the run target (by selecting the "Build"|"Open Build/Run Target Seclector..." menu or by pressing Ctrl+T); and
 - Build and run OpenCOR (by selecting the "Build"|"Run" menu or by pressing Ctrl+R).

Alternatively, you can use the batch/shell files to clean the project (using cleanall.bat on Windows or cleanall on Linux/Mac), build it (using buildall.bat on Windows or buildall on Linux/Mac) and run it (using run.vbs on Windows or run on Linux/Mac). Note that these batch/shell files require access to CMake, MinGW/g++/Xcode (for Windows, Linux and Mac, respectively) and Qt from the command line. This should be the case on Linux and Mac, but on Windows the "PATH" environment variable might need updating.

Packaging of OpenCOR is done from the command line using packageall.bat on Windows and packageall on Linux/Mac. Note that this requires NSIS on Windows (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/).
