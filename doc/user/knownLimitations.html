        <p>
            The following limitations have been observed while using OpenCOR on our <a href="supportedPlatforms.html">supported platforms</a>. They may apply to you, or not, depending on the platform you use and your specific circumstances.
        </p>

        <div class="section">
            Windows, Linux and OS X
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                By default, OpenCOR uses your system's language for menus, dialog boxes, etc., as long as it is either English or French (please <a href="contactUs.html">contact us</a> if you would like OpenCOR to support other languages). If your system uses another language, then OpenCOR will default to English. Otherwise, if you specifically specify English or French, then please be aware that system messages, dialog boxes, etc. will still be displayed using your system's language (assuming it is not one of the languages supported by OpenCOR).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section">
            Windows
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                OpenCOR's File Browser plugin may, on some systems, result in OpenCOR being slow to respond at startup. This has nothing to do with OpenCOR, but with Windows or, more precisely, a program that tightly integrates with its shell. There are <a href="http://www.brighthub.com/computing/windows-platform/articles/86552.aspx">several known causes and solutions</a> to this problem. However, should none of them work for you, then you might have to unselect the plugin.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section">
            Linux
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Depending on which <a href="plugins/index.html">plugins</a> you select, OpenCOR may need <a href="http://www.llvm.org/">LLVM</a>. If so, and in case your video card uses a driver that relies on LLVM (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium3D">Gallium3D</a> and <a href="http://www.mesa3d.org/">Mesa 3D</a>), then there may be a conflict between the version of LLVM used by OpenCOR and the version used by your video card. To address this issue, you should either use a different driver or use indirect rendering. The latter can be done either every time you run OpenCOR:

                <pre class="prettyprint">$ LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1 ./OpenCOR</pre>

                or once and for all by exporting <code>LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT</code> (e.g. in your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file):

                <pre class="prettyprint">export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1</pre>
            </li>
        </ul>
