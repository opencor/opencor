            Depending on your window manager (e.g. <A HREF = "http://www.compiz.org/">Compiz</A>), OpenCOR may experience one of the following glitches (none of which affect the good functioning of the software itself):
        </P>

        <UL>
            <LI>Upon starting OpenCOR, the software will try to retrieve your previous session's settings which may result in the main window showing up lower down the screen than it should; and</LI>
            <LI>To show the help window by pressing the F1 key may, if the help window is to be floating (as opposed to being docked to the main window), result in OpenCOR not being the active application anymore. This means that if you were to press the F1 key one more time, the help window will remain visible while it should have disappeared.</LI>
        </UL>

        <P>
            Note that the above issues have nothing to do with OpenCOR itself (everything works fine on both Windows and Mac OS X), but with the window manager that you use. Indeed, there is a lack of compliancy between the various window managers, so something that works with one window manager may or not work with another, as is unfortunately the case with OpenCOR.
        </P>

        <P>
            Another non window manager related glitch is that:
        </P>

        <UL>
            <LI>In the help window, the icon used for one of the toolbar buttons may have a slightly reddish background. The background will, however, be reset when clicking anywhere on the help text.</LI>
        </UL>

        <SPAN CLASS = "SectionFont">Mac OS X</SPAN>

        <P>
            There are currently no known issues.
