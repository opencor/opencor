        <P>
            OpenCOR uses both software- and image-based third-party libraries, all of which are listed below, together with the type of license under which they are released.
        </P>

        <P>
            In all cases, only the files actually required by OpenCOR have been included in our Git repository. In the case of a software library, a/the <SPAN CLASS = "Italic">CMakeLists.txt</SPAN> file will have been created/modified so that the library could be built as part of our <A HREF = "developBuildTestAndPackage.html#buildAndTest">build process</A>.
        </P>
